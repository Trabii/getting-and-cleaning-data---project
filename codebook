1. General:
  - the suffix _mean indicates that the mean of this variable was taken
  - the suffix _sd indicates that the standardderivation of this variable was taken
  - the data contains test as well as train data together

2.  
"subject"       <- subject identifyer
"X_mean"        <- mean of the 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables 
"X_sd"          <- sd of the 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables 
"y"             <- Activity 

3. The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
"body_acc_x_mean"  
"body_acc_x_sd"   
"body_acc_y_mean"  
"body_acc_y_sd"    
"body_acc_z_mean"  
"body_acc_z_sd"    


4. The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 
"body_gyro_x_mean" 
"body_gyro_x_sd"  
"body_gyro_y_mean" 
"body_gyro_y_sd"   
"body_gyro_z_mean" 
"body_gyro_z_sd"   

5. The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X or Y or Z axis in standard gravity units 'g'
"total_acc_x_mean" 
"total_acc_x_sd"  
"total_acc_y_mean" 
"total_acc_y_sd"   
"total_acc_z_mean" 
"total_acc_z_sd"
